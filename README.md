Project Risk Management

Risk Register
============
● One is that the school douesn't open again 
● or that someone gets sick and the others have to do more 
● or someone forgets his part and doesn't do it and more
● The main thing is that the "jobs" everyone gets aren't done, so there are going to be fights in the group. But we will manage it.
