Project Risk Management

Risk Register
============
● One is that the school douesn't open again 

● or that someone gets sick and the others have to do more 

● or someone forgets his part and doesn't do it and more

● The main thing is that the "jobs" everyone gets aren't done, so there are going to be fights in the group. But we will manage it.

We implemented a shop in our website in which you can upload cars with various brands and models. Some of the examples are: VW, Ford, Audi etc. Our shop is going to be a normal shop which works with the technology of the json server. To upload a car the user has got the oppertunity to insert an image Url, brand, price, the name of seller, phone number. Then after the user presses "submit" a Post request will be made and the files will be written into the db.json file, which is a json file. If everything worked good, and if the user doesn't get any errors, the things are written in inside the json server and everything works fine. If the user is interested he can even have a look inside of our db.json file and there he can see all the inputs that were made. But to look inside, the user has to have access to the json server. In the end we want to have a website, with the Shop working, and a bit good looking website. The website is finished, and got presented.
